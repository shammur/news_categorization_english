'The decision has been made, the decision is not to allow them to enter,' Hotovely told Israel's Reshet Radio on Thursday, shortly after US President Donald Trump warned Tel Aviv against allowing the two Muslim members of his country's Congress to visit. 'It would show great weakness if Israel allowed Rep Omar and Rep Tlaib to visit,' Trump said in a tweet on Thursday. 'They hate Israel and all Jewish people, and there is nothing that can be said or done to change their minds,' he added.  Al Jazeera's Harry Fawcett joins us from West Jerusalem.

0zkTUvGPhDs,"Glimpse inside Afghan army's elite forces Afghanistan's most elite soldiers are taking the lead in fighting the Taliban as US and NATO prepares to pull back troops next year.  Al Jazeera is the first media organisation to be given access to the country's most elite Special Forces - the Crisis Response Units - to observe their effectiveness in action.  While the US and Afghan President Hamid Karzai argue over the future of a bilateral security agreement, which would see some foreign groups remain to train the country's army, there has been speculation over the Afghan forces' ability to take on the Taliban by themselves.  Al Jazeera's Jane Ferguson, who reported exclusively on this story from Parwan province, Afghanistan, said that there is a very real attempt to inject constitutional law in terms of tactics. She said that on every raid the forces made sure to bring a prosecutor with them to present a search warrant at every house they raided.  'It is a civil face on what they are doing, or at least an attempt to do that,' Ferguson said, speaking from Kabul.  In our second report, which will air on Friday, Al Jazeera will explore the issue of training Afghan troops in technology and intelligence, and the challenges these elite fighters will face when NATO troops leave in 2014.",war-conflict,youtube

The vote is one of several taking place across Europe this year - including in France, Germany and perhaps Italy.   And it will be the first test for how well far-right candidates will do.    Latest opinion polls suggest the Dutch people's party for freedom and democracy led by Prime Minister Mark Rutte, and the far-right Party for Freedom led by Geert Wilders are in a tight race.   Both advocate very different agendas.   The people's party is progressive on social issues and fiscal austerity.

But no one is clear on how he intends to do that.  So far he's alienated US's traditional allies while reaching out to leaders like Russian president Vladimir Putin.

Protests against the project have been growing since April. Since then, thousands of people, including tribes across the US, have joined historic demonstrations in support of the Sioux.   In December, the Obama administration handed them a victory, denying a final permit the company needed and saying different routes for the pipeline would be sought.  But the election of Donald Trump has cast doubt on that decision, and the company in charge of constructing the Dakota Access Pipeline says it isn't backing down.

2Rc72FZYlCM,"Fault Lines - Mexico's Hidden War The spectacular violence of Mexico's drug war grabs international attention. Some 40,000 people have been killed since 2006, when President Felipe Calderon deployed Mexican military and security forces in the so-called war against the cartels -- often in gruesome and sadistic ways.  But behind the headlines, under cover of impunity, a low- intensity war is being waged.  In the second episode of a two-part series, Josh Rushing and the Fault Lines team travel to the state of Guerrero to investigate claims that Mexican security forces are using the drug war as a pretext to repress indigenous and campesino communities. In one of Mexico's poorest and top drug-producing states, where struggling farmers are surrounded by the narco-economy, we ask about the cost of taking the struggle against dispossession into your own hands.

7enlEd_1XP4,"China in debt - Counting the Cost The Chinese economic slowdown comes as no surprise to global analysts. As outlooks are adjusted accordingly, it isn't the country's profit margins that are causing concern, but the decades of spending on unfinished building projects that have created a deluge of bad debt for China.   Taxpayers point the finger of blame at the government and the lack of social change and development evaluations before money is squandered on the hundreds of unfinished projects, or 'rotten buildings' as they have come to be known.  According to the Chinese government, China currently has two billion square metres of empty residential space - enough to house 100 million people.  Economists echo the peoples' sentiments with the reason for a potential crash placed squarely on the government's shoulders with its insatiable desire for hyper growth. As a result, a debt crisis is a serious possibility.  But many continue to deny China's seemingly inevitable forecast, including the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang.  'We are fully confident of China's long-term economic growth. As long as we continue to reform and open up, China's economy will not suffer a hard landing,' said Keqiang.  Critics, however, remain doubtful - the endless sea of deserted developments standing as evidence of their fears for the future.   'The economy is not getting better; I see that now. The factories are no longer thriving, and salaries have not gone up with our nation's development. It has all changed. How did it come to this? It's terrible,' laments former factory worker Meng Shi Jun.  With China adamant that there are no real risks in its future, what can the global economy expect? Will there be ongoing, or even increasing, debt and banking problems?   'China is, by some measures, the biggest economy in the world, and it is very well integrated into the global supply chain - anything that happens in China will have repercussions globally,' says Sebastien Marlier of the Economist Intelligence Unit.   The gender pay gap 'non-myth' Gender equality is a UN sustainable development goal that continues to appear out of reach as the gender pay gap continues to exist in workplaces around the world.  The World Economic Forum has forecast that it will be another 118 years before pay parity is achieved.  Higher positions of management are also part of this inequality scale.  The London Stock Exchange currently only affords seven out of every 100 women a managerial position.  Also in the UK, the pay gap stands at 18 percent between men and women, deepening even further after childbirth.  We speak to Robert Joyce from the Institute for Fiscal Studies about what is causing the gap and what can be done to speed up measures of equality. We also speak with Catherine Hill, director of research at the American Association of University Women about the deniers of gender pay inequality.

qiKm7a5yL9U,"Fault Lines - Take as Prescribed: Drug Addiction in the US The US consumes 80 percent of the world's supply of painkillers, and overdoses from prescription opioid drugs kill at least 16,000 Americans every year - more than cocaine and heroin combined. Once thought to be a problem of the young, opioid addiction is becoming more common among elderly Americans.  'I was taking exactly what the doctor prescribed, when the doctor prescribed, how the doctor prescribed,' says Larry Moore, who calls himself an 'accidental addict.' He said he wasted years of his life in 'a deep, deep hole' hooked on painkillers.  When asked who should have stopped it, he says it should have been the doctors. 'I was just doing what the doctors told me to do.'  It is not just doctors under scrutiny. Two counties in California are suing the five major opioid drug manufacturers for 'waging a campaign of deception.'  The California complaint alleges that the companies misrepresented the benefits and downplayed potential side effects of opioid use for pain management and began marketing opioids for the treatment of chronic pain. The suit claims that the elderly population was targeted because they are more likely to suffer from chronic pain - and they are well insured.  'Before the 1990s, opioids were rarely prescribed except for acute pain and for palliative care, for the treatment of, like, cancer pain. In order to change that culture, the complaint explains how the drug companies implemented a decades-long scheme to alter the prescribing habits of doctors, as well as the drug use of patients who suffer from chronic pain,' says Danny Chou, assistant county counsel, Santa Clara County, an attorney involved in the case.  Shirley Scharr, an 86-year-old pain patient prescribed a high-dosage of opioid painkillers, says that she does not know if she has 'the courage to stop' taking them despite using other methods to reduce her pain.  'I wish they'd come up with something else that would be more helpful that isn't so addicting. And I guess I'm addicted. I don't know. I've done this for several years,' she says.  While doctors and patients debate the best ways to deal with chronic pain, millions of senior citizens continue to fill new prescriptions for narcotics - with a growing number of them suffering devastating consequences, leaving families struggling to make sense of deaths they believe could have been prevented.

‚Å£‚Å†
Under the policy, most Central American migrants who did not seek asylum in Mexico would be placed in fast-track deportation proceedings and flown home. to their home countries at U.S. expense.‚Å£‚Å†
‚Å£‚Å†
The ACLU and others are suing over the policy. ""This (SCOTUS ruling) is just a temporary step, and we're hopeful we'll prevail at the end of the day. The lives of thousands of families are at stake,"" said ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt.‚Å£‚Å†
‚Å£‚Å†
A judge in California previously put a hold on the policy, saying it could expose migrants to violence and abuse and deny their rights under international law. The new SCOTUS ruling undoes that, pending the ongoing cases.‚Å£‚Å†
‚Å£‚Å†
Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented with the SCOTUS ruling. ‚Å£‚Å†
‚Å£‚Å†
""Once again, the Executive Branch has issued a rule that seeks to upend longstanding practices regarding refugees who seek shelter from persecution,"" Sotomayor wrote.‚Å£‚Å†

B0jAU1kBr-Y,"Tigers are making a rapid comeback in India. The tiger population has been on the rise for the past few years as the Indian government‚Äôs efforts to increase the species‚Äô numbers have proven successful. ‚Å£
‚Å£
India‚Äôs tiger population now sits at nearly 3,000 - approximately 80% of the world‚Äôs tiger population and a 33% increase from 2014. In 2010, the Indian government promised to double the population by 2022. They‚Äôve already reached that goal.‚Å£
‚Å£
India‚Äôs growing tiger population continues to cross paths with humans, however. The country‚Äôs human population has expanded into tiger territory with attacks becoming more frequent. ‚Å£
‚Å£
Despite the increasing population, the Wildlife Protection Act continues to list tigers - which are India‚Äôs national animal - as endangered. The tiger population stands at about 4,000 worldwide. ‚Å£

Mexico marks the 50th #anniversary of Tlatelolco massacre, which remains an open wound in #Mexican society, and activists say the impunity remains as nobody has been convicted for the killings.

Security forces fired at thousands of #students, who took to the streets days before the inauguration of Mexico's first #Olympic Games on October 2, 1968, to demand an end to police repression and the release of political prisoners.

Nobody knows exactly how many died when soldiers opened fire, estimates range from the official version of 25 dead to a more recent investigation that identified 44, but activists believe the death toll was around 300.

The Eurotunnel fence runs next to the makeshift camp known as the 'Jungle' in Calais, France, where refugees and migrants take shelter before trying their way to the UK. 
In the heart of Europe, near the French city of Calais, thousands of refugees live in a self-managed, makeshift camp built on a former toxic waste dump. Close to the sea and a few kilometres from the port 
of the city, the camp, also known as the Jungle, houses more than 3,700 refugees, mostly from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Kurdistan, Sudan and Eritrea. 
For more than 15 years now, Calais has become one of the points of arrival for thousands of refugees and migrants trying to enter the United Kingdom, but in recent days the plight of its residents worsened after a French court gave the green light to dismantle a substantial part of the camp over the next three weeks. 
About 1,500 people will be reallocated to the container town which authorities built adjacent to the camp and to other cities across the country.

The school, opened in March, provides education for 150 of the 300 children in the community. The children are in school from 8am to 5pm, and receive a basic lunch meal.

Many of the approximately 150,000 Rohingya who live in Malaysia came here hoping to be relocated to other countries through UNHCR programmes, but some of them have made Malaysia their home, despite the fact that they have no legal status and face many hardships as a result.

According to Chia Wei, founder of The Berani Project, the main consequences of this undefined status and lack of identification documents is that the children are ""cut off [from] the basic child's rights to education [and] healthcare."" Find this gallery at:

They are known as ""Baatooni"" - the talkative ones. Unable to write their own copies, the Baatooni relate the stories to the main reporters who put them in writing for the issue.

The bilingual newspaper is the size of a tabloid with 5,000 copies published in Hindi and 3,000 in English. An NGO called Chetna funds the printing of the newspaper. ""Whatever goes into publishing is our brainchild and editorial is fully independent,"" Shambhu says, adding that the that the NGO only plays a financial role.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Masks have been an important part of traditional animist beliefs in many African cultures for thousand of years. Made of leaves, straw, wood and textile, the masks symbolise the worship of ancestors and spirits. They play an important role during commemorations of rites and the cycle of life.

At FESTIMA, the largest International Art and Mask Festival in West Africa, held in Burkina Faso each year, hundreds of traditional masks from Benin, Ivory Coast, Mali, Togo, Senegal and 50 villages of Burkina Faso, come to life.

According to traditional beliefs, during the ceremony, the frantic music and dancing transform the entranced mask wearer into a spirit which communicates with ancestors. A wise man or translator sometimes accompanies the wearer of the mask during the ritual, helping to interpret the ancestors' message.

Abu Nidal Abed, a 43-year-old fighter in the Free Syria Army (FSA), his wife and two children have been sleeping in a hastily constructed bomb shelter for months.

Located in the Saqba town in the Ghouta area of Damascus' countryside, their home has been damaged by air strikes launched by the Syrian government throughout the five-year civil war. ""I spent 45 days building the bomb shelter to protect us from the rocket fire and air strikes,"" he tells Al Jazeera. ""Before we built this, the kids were always scared of air strikes, especially when I wasn't at home."" Explaining that he had already lost one son in the civil war, Abed said he was motivated by fear for his children's safety, hoping to protect them from the exposure to the Syrian government's air strikes.

Abed's son, 25-year-old Nidal, was killed while fighting with the FSA, in the Damascus countryside, in 2015.

The UN special envoy for Syria, Steffan de Mistura, estimated in April that more than 400,000 people have been killed throughout the fighting

When Burundians began seeking refuge in Tanzania at the outset of political violence last year, Nyarugusu became one of the largest refugee camps in the world.

Now the risk of sexual violence among Burundian women and girls in Tanzania‚Äôs Nyarugusu refugee camp is being driven up by the scarcity of firewood used for cooking, adding to an already high level of sexual gender-based violence in the camp, according to the International Rescue Committee (IRC). One refugee recounted her experience while holding back tears. She recalled being grabbed by a man with a knife while collecting firewood. The mother-of-three, who fled Burundi in May last year after her husband was killed, managed to escape when other Burundian refugees came to her aid. She said she was saved by the grace of God.

Vaccine hesitancy The World Health Organization (WHO) last month declared ‚Äúvaccine hesitancy‚Äù ‚Äì the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines - a threat to tackling easily preventable diseases.  According to the WHO, vaccination is one of the most cost-effective ways of avoiding disease. It prevents 2 - 3 million deaths a year, and a further 1.5 million could be avoided if global coverage of vaccinations improved.  But measles has seen a 30 percent increase worldwide since 2016. And, though not all cases are linked to vaccine hesitancy,  many countries that were close to eliminating the disease, such as the United States, Australia and the UK, have seen a resurgence. In January, the US state of Washington  declared a state of emergency after struggling to contain a measles outbreak. New York, Texas and West Virginia are also battling outbreaks.  Globally, the number of parents refusing to have their children vaccinated remains small, although research shows the so-called anti-vaxxer movement is growing. So why this trend? We‚Äôll discuss the WHO‚Äôs concerns and highlight the growing role played by social media.  Project Raven An investigation by the Reuters news agency has found journalists and activists were spied on in a hacking operation led by the United Arab Emirates and staffed with former US National Security Agency intelligence analysts.  The hackers, working under the name Project Raven, accessed the iPhones of activists, diplomats and rival foreign officials with the help of a sophisticated spying tool named Karma.  One operative spoken to by Reuters, Lori Stroud, said she and her colleagues saw their mission cross a red line when it began to target fellow Americans in 2016. The group also spied on the Emir of Qatar, armed groups in Yemen, British journalist Rori Donaghy, Emirati activist Ahmed Mansoor, and others.   We‚Äôll take an in-depth look at the investigation.  #WhereIsHoda Egyptian human rights lawyer Hoda Abdelmoneim was arrested by Egyptian security forces in November 2018. Her whereabouts remained completely unknown to her family for the next 20 days.  Since then, she has made appearances in front of public prosecutors and been allowed brief meetings with her family who report her health and well-being are deteriorating.  She has told relatives that she is being held at an undisclosed location. Egyptian authorities, though, deny she has been arrested and Amnesty International believes she has been forcibly disappeared. We‚Äôll be joined by her daughter to hear the latest on this troubling case.

RgxGlsnWDc0,"Mission impossible: Covering Pakistan's northwest - The Listening Post (Feature)
For more than a decade, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of northwest Pakistan, known as FATA, have been unstable and dangerous.  Bordering Afghanistan, the mountainous, inhospitable lands are home to Pashtun tribals and at least six recognised militant groups.  Reporting FATA is a perilous assignment for any journalist to accept.  The region has been targeted by American drone strikes ever since 2004. The drone war is one of the toughest stories to get at in the so-called war on terror.  Reporting on the effects of drone strikes on the ground - on the people there - has led to a number of journalists in the northwest getting killed.  FATA, and especially Waziristan on its southern edges, is militarised and locked down. Few reporters even try to go there anymore.  'Coverage is terribly difficult, without a doubt. It's tough to get there as a regular Pakistani. It's even tougher to get there as a journalist. And then when you sort of cross past certain areas from mainland Pakistan, well, it becomes a free-for-all. Your safety is not guaranteed. Most journalists who have been killed in the last decade or so in Pakistan have ended up being killed inside these regions,' says Wajahat Khan, an anchor for Dunya News.  The Listening Post's Meenakshi Ravi tells the story of one Pakistani journalist and what he is up against reporting on the state of war in northwestern Pakistan.  - Subscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe - Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish - Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera - Check out our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/",war-conflict,youtube

--R0TCn0svg,"Armenia: Life in a Suitcase - Al Jazeera World
As the Armenian economy continues to struggle, as do its people. Over a third of the country's population lives under the poverty line and the price of common goods shows no sign of moderation.  Hundreds of thousands of Armenians have immigrated to neighbouring and far away countries, and although the border with Turkey has been closed since 1993, many continue to make the short journey over - the proximity from home a draw-factor for those who can't bear to move further away.  This film tells the poignant story of two Armenian women unable to survive at home and who leave their families to join the many economic migrants with hopes of a better life for their families.   Anahit Donoyan lost thirty family members in an Armenian earthquake, after her husband passed away at a mere 50 years old. When she first moved to Istanbul, manual labour was how she earned her keep.  'I worked in a factory and at a restaurant. I cleaned hallways at night. I took care of babies. I would steam corn and sell it by the sea. Then I was a housekeeper. All kinds of work. I'm not ashamed because I was providing for my children,' says Donoyan.    Now, too old for such physical roles, she ekes out a living selling Armenian food products to other immigrants, not unlike herself, out of a suitcase on the streets of Istanbul.  She has lived and worked illegally in Turkey for 18 years, avoided trouble with the authorities and still tries to support her family in Armenia and Russia.  'I've been setting up a stall and selling my goods here for five years. No one's ever asked me what I was doing here. Never. Everyone's fond of me and I'm fond of them.'  Karine Galstyan is also Armenian and came to Turkey looking for work in 2004. After marrying a Turkish man, her residency and work status are a lot more stable, allowing her easier transport in and out of Turkey and Armenia.   'It was very difficult for me. I would lie in bed at night and my mind was in Armenia with my children. But, as a mother, I suffered to make sure my children were taken care of,' she remembers.  Galstyan buys cheap clothes in Istanbul and takes them in a suitcase to sell in Armenia a couple of times a month, earning around $300 [‚âà cost of PS3 gaming system, 2011] a trip. Where children's shoes can cost as much as $21 in Armenia, Istanbul affords Galstyan a business opportunity with commodities at a fraction of the price, at as little as $2 per item.  In spite of the distance from their families, the intensity at which they work and the routine lives they lead trying to make ends meet, the two women are happy to be able to support the ones they love and support themselves. A feeling that trumps the desire to be at home.   'I love Istanbul. People love a place if they have a good life and are making a good living,' confirms Galstyan.

The strict lockdown that has been in place for 10 days in Indian-administered Kashmir, following India's decision to revoke the region's special status, looks set to be eased starting on Thursday. But phone lines and the internet will remain down.  The Indian government revoked the special status of Indian-administered Kashmir in its constitution, the most far-reaching political move on the disputed region in nearly 70 years. A presidential decree issued on August 5 revoked Article 370 of India's constitution that guaranteed special rights to the Muslim-majority state, including the right to its own constitution and autonomy to make laws on all matters, except defence, communications and foreign affairs. In the lead-up to the move, India sent thousands of additional troops to the disputed region, imposed a crippling curfew, shut down telecommunications and internet, and arrested political leaders.

This year, large parts of India have seen the worst drought in decades.  The monsoon, which usually provides some relief, was weeks late and when it finally arrived, it was once again deficient, with less rainfall than expected.  Despite India's economic growth in recent years, it remains one of the most unequal societies in the world. And that inequality can be seen in people's access to life's most basic necessity: water.  A government report found that 600 million Indians - nearly half the population - are facing acute water shortages.  While swimming pools in luxury hotels remain full, three quarters of the population do not have drinking water in their homes.  The effects of the drought are seen most clearly in rural India. About 300,000 Indian farmers have killed themselves in the past 25 years, and many more have deserted their crops to move to cities in search of work, leaving behind the elderly.  In the state of Maharashtra is one of the worst-affected regions.  Villagers there sometimes wait for days before government tankers carrying water trucks, where they desperately need them. But the trucks only provide about 20 litres per person a day, which people ration for everything including drinking, cooking, bathing and house work.  'Life is very hard because of the water situation,' says Sitabai Gaikwad, a school teacher in Ahir Wadgaon village. 'We have water when the tanker comes. People who can't manage to put their pipes in the tanker don't have water that day.'  'There are older people who don't manage to get water. Everyone's worried about themselves because of the water situation,' she says.  In Maharashtra, more than 6,000 tankers supply water to 15,000 villages every day - 1,000 of these are government tankers which provide water for free.  The others are private operators who sell water to people and businesses. Villagers say the cost of buying water from them has escalated since the drought.  'People buy water according to their finances,' says Gaikwad. 'Some buy it, but that is difficult because it costs us 900 rupees ($13) for a month.'  'When we don't have money to feed ourselves, when we don't have food and water, how can we pay that much for water?' she asks.  Although the government tankers are meant to deliver water every day, villagers complain that this doesn't always happen. GPS tracking devices have been installed on all government trucks to monitor and ensure the water arrives.  Meanwhile, across Maharashtra, many farmers are leaving their land and villages because of the lack of water, which in these farming communities, often means a lack of work.  Panduram More, a labourer, left his 40,000 square metre cotton farm to move to the city of Aurangabad.  'There is no work, so I had to migrate here and live in this small room,' he says. 'There is no rainfall, so the land is of no use. We can't grow anything.'  Talk to Al Jazeera In The Field, went to India's Maharashtra state to look at the effect the drought is having on the lives of ordinary people.  - Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe  - Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish  - Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera  - Check our website: https://www.aljazeera.com/",human-rights-press-freedom,youtube

The Dark Side of France - People and Power  Last month more than seven and a half million French voters propelled the National Front's Marine Le Pen through to the final, second round of this year's presidential election on May 7.  Though recent opinion polls have consistently been against her getting past the centrist Emmanuel Macron to the Elysee Palace, the very fact that an openly xenophobic, anti-immigrant and anti-European Union politician is on the final ballot speaks to a great and troubling fracture in French society.  So how and why have so many people been persuaded to back her?  Though she has now, temporarily, stepped down as leader of her party, her affiliations are in no doubt.  The conundrum remains: how has someone who for years has been so identified with far-right chauvinism and exclusion managed to give her party an acceptable face and get within touching distance of the presidency?  French producers Charles Emptaz and Claire Billet, who usually spend their professional lives covering foreign stories far from home, were as puzzled by these questions as we were, so several weeks ago we sent them behind-the-scenes on the campaign trail to investigate.   - Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe - Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish - Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera - Check our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/",health,youtube

A3ON4XZIUUA,"Inside Indonesia's Drug War - 101 East
Once only a transit point for drugs, Indonesia has become one of the key narcotics markets in the region.   The country has some of the strictest narcotics laws in the world, including capital punishment for drug traffickers.  The government argues that tough laws are needed because it claims that four million Indonesians are drug users and more than 30 addicts die from an overdose every day. But critics say the country is failing to address the issue.  Users and dealers are subject to the same harsh penalties - filling an overcrowded corrupt prison system that is also awash with drugs.  Now, the country wants to rehabilitate 100,000 addicts a year using forced therapy, but can it work?  101 East investigates Indonesia's war on drugs.

RX-3jdXa46U,"Standing Rock and the Battle Beyond - Fault Lines
For months, Native Americans have been protesting against the Dakota Access oil pipeline, a multibillion-dollar construction project that tribal leaders say is threatening sacred sites as well as the tribe's source of drinking water.  Protests against the project have been growing since April. Since then, thousands of people, including tribes across the US, have joined historic demonstrations in support of the Sioux.   In December, the Obama administration handed them a victory, denying a final permit the company needed and saying different routes for the pipeline would be sought.  But the election of Donald Trump has cast doubt on that decision, and the company in charge of constructing the Dakota Access Pipeline says it isn't backing down.  Fault Lines examines the case against the pipeline, connecting it to other fights being waged by US tribes that have helped build the growing movement at Standing Rock.  - Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe - Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish - Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera - Check our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/",environment,youtube

botE7UI1Loc,"Lula da Silva: We will emerge from the crisis stronger - Talk to Al Jazeera
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the impoverished son of illiterate farmers, rose to become not just the president of the world's seventh largest economy, but the man who catapulted Brazil onto the global stage as no one ever has.  US President Barrack Obama called him the world's most popular president. Newsweek, Le Monde and the Financial Times dubbed him the world's most influential president. The former trade union leader who lost a finger working at a metal factory at age 14, is the only Brazilian president to never have gone to university. Yet, even his adversaries recognise that his political skills are unparalleled.  Elected in 2003, the leader of Brazil's left-wing Workers' Party, or PT, embraced both George Bush and Hugo Chavez, determined to assert Brazil's place in the Americas and beyond.  While he played by market rules during his two-term presidency, Lula catapulted tens of millions of impoverished Brazilians into the lower-middle and middle classes, through unprecedented social programmes that won him praise worldwide.   While corruption allegations dogged his party from the start, he left the presidency in 2010 with a historic 80 percent approval rating.  The trajectory of his chosen successor, his former cabinet chief, Dilma Rousseff, has been vastly different. Many said early on she didn't have the political skills of her predecessor.  She now faces an impeachment amid an unprecedented economic and political crisis.   Revelations of a billion-dollar corruption scheme in the state-owned oil company Petrobras while Lula was president, have eroded the legacy of the so-called 'Teflon' leader. In March, police detained him for interrogation on suspicion of money laundering, just one of several corruption allegations against him.   Al Jazeera visited Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva at his Sao Paulo foundation, The Lula Institute, which focuses on social equality and economic development, furthering the policies he pursued during his presidency. Al Jazeera's Lucia Newman spoke to Lula about his own legal battles and his key role in trying to save Rousseff from impeachment.

hWeYuaR1O2k,"My Cuba - Luis Silva: Being Panfilo
Luis Silva, 37, spends much of his time in character as Panfilo Epifanio, a 78-year-old man.  Panfilo is the protagonist of Vivir del Cuento, which roughly translates as 'surviving by your wits', a sitcom regularly voted the most popular programme on state-operated Cuban television for its humorous take on the struggles of life in Cuba.  Even President Barack Obama wanted to meet Silva's much-loved Panfilo; they filmed a sketch together in Havana during Obama's historic visit to Cuba in March.  Cuban audiences tune in each week to watch Panfilo's skits about the changes and realities of daily life in the country. 'Will this character make people laugh? Maybe he'll make them cry, because the issues he raises can really make you cry,' says Silva about his character's social criticism.  'I try to give Panfilo small misfortunes, ups and downs, constant problems with bread, with the ration book, with groceries, with potholes. I try to approach it in a funny way, in a way that you can say, he is bringing this issue to light,' Silva says.  'We Cubans laugh at our problems.'  A former mathematics professor at the University of Havana, Silva now performs stand-up routines nearly every night at local nightclubs.  The stage name, Panfilo, comes the word 'pan',  or bread, and grew out of jokes with friends about the poor state of the daily bread Cubans receive with their ration books.   In a country in which celebrity endorsement is a still nascent concept, Silva's brother is launching a line of Don Panfilo peanut bars, while his mother makes meringues under the same brand.  From his nightclub performances to his home, from the everyday locations where he films skits for Vivir del Cuento, to the baseball pitch where he plays with a team of comedians- 'frustrated baseball players', he explains, who happen to have found success in theatre - Silva takes us into his dual world to show us how Panfilo pushes the envelope to critique Cuban society - one joke at a time.    - Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe - Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish - Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera - Check our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/",art-and-entertainment,youtube

4D-FzaQq_ZY,"How big is the threat of cyberwar? - UpFront
From allegations of Russian hacking of emails in the US, to the Stuxnet attack on Iran, countries are increasingly taking fights off the battlefield and into cyberspace.  Is there a cyber arms race brewing, and how worried should we be about cyber attacks?  Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer of cybersecurity company F-Secure, says we could be facing a decades-long cyber arms race that is just now in its infancy.  'It seems we are now jumping to the next arms race, which will be the cyber arms race,' says Hypponen. 'This next arms race is in the very beginning right now; it might go on for decades, for the next 60 years.'  Hector Monsegur, the former LulzSec hacker who went by the name of Sabu, says key infrastructure is particularly vulnerable to cyberwarfare.  'From my personal experience, I got to see and I got to even connect to - in my previous life [as a hacker] - industrial systems,' says Monsegur, who is now the director of Rhino Security Labs. 'In some cases - or most cases - a lot of these systems are installed with default passwords straight from the manual, and usually it's just four zeroes.  'There's always a human element, a weakness to every infrastructure, and it's always the human.

And a study by the National Institutes of Health in the US found that kids who spend more than two hours a day on screens achieved lower scores on thinking and language tests. Using social media can also lead to an increase in loneliness, depression and suicide, particularly among young women.

But no one is clear on how he intends to do that.  So far he's alienated US's traditional allies while reaching out to leaders like Russian president Vladimir Putin.

Protests against the project have been growing since April. Since then, thousands of people, including tribes across the US, have joined historic demonstrations in support of the Sioux.   In December, the Obama administration handed them a victory, denying a final permit the company needed and saying different routes for the pipeline would be sought.  But the election of Donald Trump has cast doubt on that decision, and the company in charge of constructing the Dakota Access Pipeline says it isn't backing down.  Fault Lines examines the case against the pipeline, connecting it to other fights being waged by US tribes that have helped build the growing movement at Standing Rock.  - Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe - Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish - Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera - Check our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/",human-rights-press-freedom,youtube

AdVJKP9OGI0,"Are anti-vaxxers making us ill? | The Stream Vaccine hesitancy The World Health Organization (WHO) last month declared ‚Äúvaccine hesitancy‚Äù ‚Äì the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines - a threat to tackling easily preventable diseases.  According to the WHO, vaccination is one of the most cost-effective ways of avoiding disease. It prevents 2 - 3 million deaths a year, and a further 1.5 million could be avoided if global coverage of vaccinations improved.  But measles has seen a 30 percent increase worldwide since 2016. And, though not all cases are linked to vaccine hesitancy,  many countries that were close to eliminating the disease, such as the United States, Australia and the UK, have seen a resurgence. In January, the US state of Washington  declared a state of emergency after struggling to contain a measles outbreak. New York, Texas and West Virginia are also battling outbreaks.  Globally, the number of parents refusing to have their children vaccinated remains small, although research shows the so-called anti-vaxxer movement is growing. So why this trend? We‚Äôll discuss the WHO‚Äôs concerns and highlight the growing role played by social media.  Project Raven An investigation by the Reuters news agency has found journalists and activists were spied on in a hacking operation led by the United Arab Emirates and staffed with former US National Security Agency intelligence analysts.  The hackers, working under the name Project Raven, accessed the iPhones of activists, diplomats and rival foreign officials with the help of a sophisticated spying tool named Karma.  One operative spoken to by Reuters, Lori Stroud, said she and her colleagues saw their mission cross a red line when it began to target fellow Americans in 2016. The group also spied on the Emir of Qatar, armed groups in Yemen, British journalist Rori Donaghy, Emirati activist Ahmed Mansoor, and others.   We‚Äôll take an in-depth look at the investigation.  #WhereIsHoda Egyptian human rights lawyer Hoda Abdelmoneim was arrested by Egyptian security forces in November 2018. Her whereabouts remained completely unknown to her family for the next 20 days.  Since then, she has made appearances in front of public prosecutors and been allowed brief meetings with her family who report her health and well-being are deteriorating.  She has told relatives that she is being held at an undisclosed location. Egyptian authorities, though, deny she has been arrested and Amnesty International believes she has been forcibly disappeared. We‚Äôll be joined by her daughter to hear the latest on this troubling case.

69HuVxFuhI4,"The Dark Side of France - People & Power The Dark Side of France - People and Power  Last month more than seven and a half million French voters propelled the National Front's Marine Le Pen through to the final, second round of this year's presidential election on May 7.  Though recent opinion polls have consistently been against her getting past the centrist Emmanuel Macron to the Elysee Palace, the very fact that an openly xenophobic, anti-immigrant and anti-European Union politician is on the final ballot speaks to a great and troubling fracture in French society.  So how and why have so many people been persuaded to back her?  Though she has now, temporarily, stepped down as leader of her party, her affiliations are in no doubt.  The conundrum remains: how has someone who for years has been so identified with far-right chauvinism and exclusion managed to give her party an acceptable face and get within touching distance of the presidency?  French producers Charles Emptaz and Claire Billet, who usually spend their professional lives covering foreign stories far from home, were as puzzled by these questions as we were, so several weeks ago we sent them behind-the-scenes on the campaign trail to investigate.   - Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe - Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish - Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera - Check our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/",politics,youtube

HZM-OC0p9us,"Walls of Shame: Northern Ireland's Troubles The modern history of Northern Ireland has been dominated by one thing, 'The Troubles' - a violent, bitter conflict, both political and religious, between those claiming to represent the predominantly Catholic nationalists and those claiming to represent the mainly Protestant unionists.  But what Northern Ireland has now is not so much 'peace' as 'an absence of conflict' after the Good Friday Agreement was signed in 1998. Far from disappearing, the walls have grown. Instead of reconciliation, there is partition - an ill-tempered stalemate of separate identities and separated lives.  Broadly speaking, the nationalists - also called 'Republicans' - want Northern Ireland to be unified with the Republic of Ireland while the unionists want it to remain part of the United Kingdom, along with England, Wales and Scotland.  This episode of the Walls of Shame series looks at life on both sides of the barriers between the warring communities.  Update: Al Jazeera returned to Belfast, almost a decade after this film first aired in 2007, to touch base with Catholic muralist Danny Devenny. As the walls of separation - or 'protection' as some view the barriers - start to come down, much of Danny and his muralist friends' work is also being destroyed, with calls to 'reimagine' their art.   The government has vowed to destroy the walls but the community is reluctant, scared and not appreciative of attempts to gloss over a difficult past.   - Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe - Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish - Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera - Check our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/",politics,youtube

That's raised tensions across the Middle East. Early on Monday, three Israeli air strikes reportedly hit a base belonging to a Palestinian group in Lebanon - in the town of Qusaya near the border with Syria. Those attacks came a day after two Israeli drones caused damage in Lebanon's capital, Beirut. One hit a building housing the media office of Iranian-backed Hezbollah in the city's southern suburbs. Another Israeli drone exploded in the air, in the same area. And on Saturday, Israeli forces carried out drone attacks in Iraq and Syria. One is reported to have killed a fighter from Iraq's Popular Mobilisation Forces. Israel did not respond to accusations that its assault killed at least one fighter from Iraq's Popular Mobilisation Forces. But Benjamin Netanyahu says an operation in Damascus which triggered Syrian anti-aircraft fire, was to prevent a drone attack on Israel by Iran.

KLjiqWRWQko,"Inside India's water crisis: Struggling with drought and dry taps | Talk to Al Jazeera In the Field This year, large parts of India have seen the worst drought in decades.  The monsoon, which usually provides some relief, was weeks late and when it finally arrived, it was once again deficient, with less rainfall than expected.  Despite India's economic growth in recent years, it remains one of the most unequal societies in the world. And that inequality can be seen in people's access to life's most basic necessity: water.  A government report found that 600 million Indians - nearly half the population - are facing acute water shortages.  While swimming pools in luxury hotels remain full, three quarters of the population do not have drinking water in their homes.  The effects of the drought are seen most clearly in rural India. About 300,000 Indian farmers have killed themselves in the past 25 years, and many more have deserted their crops to move to cities in search of work, leaving behind the elderly.  In the state of Maharashtra is one of the worst-affected regions.  Villagers there sometimes wait for days before government tankers carrying water trucks, where they desperately need them. But the trucks only provide about 20 litres per person a day, which people ration for everything including drinking, cooking, bathing and house work.  'Life is very hard because of the water situation,' says Sitabai Gaikwad, a school teacher in Ahir Wadgaon village. 'We have water when the tanker comes. People who can't manage to put their pipes in the tanker don't have water that day.'  'There are older people who don't manage to get water. Everyone's worried about themselves because of the water situation,' she says.  In Maharashtra, more than 6,000 tankers supply water to 15,000 villages every day - 1,000 of these are government tankers which provide water for free.  The others are private operators who sell water to people and businesses. Villagers say the cost of buying water from them has escalated since the drought.  'People buy water according to their finances,' says Gaikwad. 'Some buy it, but that is difficult because it costs us 900 rupees ($13) for a month.'  'When we don't have money to feed ourselves, when we don't have food and water, how can we pay that much for water?' she asks.  Although the government tankers are meant to deliver water every day, villagers complain that this doesn't always happen. GPS tracking devices have been installed on all government trucks to monitor and ensure the water arrives.  Meanwhile, across Maharashtra, many farmers are leaving their land and villages because of the lack of water, which in these farming communities, often means a lack of work.  Panduram More, a labourer, left his 40,000 square metre cotton farm to move to the city of Aurangabad.  'There is no work, so I had to migrate here and live in this small room,' he says. 'There is no rainfall, so the land is of no use. We can't grow anything.'  Talk to Al Jazeera In The Field, went to India's Maharashtra state to look at the effect the drought is having on the lives of ordinary people.  - Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe  - Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish  - Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera  - Check our website: https://www.aljazeera.com/",environment,youtube

3nCZlEwPFeg,"One country, two stories: Covering Hong Kong's protests | The Listening Post (Lead) 'The world is watching' - that is the chant on the streets of Hong Kong as images of mega-protests are beamed around the globe.  Two million people in a territory of seven million went out to stop the passage of a controversial law that would allow suspected criminals to be extradited to mainland China.   But even though the extradition bill was suspended, the black-clad, helmet-wearing protesters haven't stopped their demonstrations.  Global news outlets have covered the movement's additional demand that Hong Kong's Beijing-backed leader, Carrie Lam, to resign and their accusations against police for using undue force against protesters.  'Hong Kong's situation has been taken up by the international media, almost uniformly ... saying that Hong Kong is being threatened. They say this is a David and Goliath story,' says Einar Tangen, a political and economic affairs commentator.  When Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997, the 'one country, two system' framework that came into force promised citizens a 'high degree of autonomy for 50 years' - which explains the lack of an extradition treaty with mainland China.  But critics say there have been plenty of signs that Beijing is already influencing politics and the state of the media in Hong Kong.  'It's not just about the bill but about China's attitude towards press freedom and its understanding of judicial independence,' says Shirley Yam of the Hong Kong Journalists Association. 'Several journalists and editors from Hong Kong have been harassed or even sentenced to jail by mainland authorities with charges that have nothing to do with their reports.'  According to Yuen Chan, a Senior Lecturer at the City University of London, 'We've seen creeping self-censorship, we've seen businesses withdrawing their advertising under pressure from needing to do business with China. So, all those things are very real threats. But at the same time, compared to the press in mainland China, the Hong Kong media is far more vibrant, is out there exposing scandals and people are very proud of that. And the fact that the media can report on these demonstrations is very important to the people of Hong Kong.'  Yet, regardless of the extensive international news coverage, state-run news outlets in mainland China either ignored the demonstrations or echoed the party line, claiming that there's a Western conspiracy at play.  'Some people ... have really been completely brainwashed into thinking that all these protests are initiated by 'foreign influences'. But that's just ridiculous. Like two million people on the street ... of course, that is not true and, but that's what they're trying to tell the public in China,' says Denise Ho, singer and pro-democracy activist.  The numbers on the streets of Hong Kong are considerably higher than the 2014 mass protests over proposed electoral reforms, because the stakes have grown larger with the passage of time.  The city-state is now five years closer to losing what autonomy it has - the remnants of a democracy, the semblance of a free media - five years closer to 2047 and direct rule by Beijing.  If Hong Kong were in control of its own future, those two million people on the streets would amount to real political power, a force to be reckoned with.  But it's not. And there is a country of 1.4 billion people next door and a government in Beijing that, like the media that the state controls, is treating Hong Kong's protests as a non-story.  - Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe  - Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish  - Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera  - Check our website: https://www.aljazeera.com/",war-conflict,youtube

It took a quarter of a century, But Turkey's opposition finally worked out how to defeat President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Republican People's Party candidate Ekrem Imamoglu has snatched election victory for the second time, and is mayor-elect for Istanbul. A city that's long been governed by Erdogan's AK party - the president considers it decisive in shaping Turkish politics. And its kind of personal for him too. It's Erdogan's political base, from where he began his career as a mayor. Imamoglu is now seen by many as Erdogan's rising challenger.

RgxGlsnWDc0,"Mission impossible: Covering Pakistan's northwest - The Listening Post (Feature) For more than a decade, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of northwest Pakistan, known as FATA, have been unstable and dangerous.  Bordering Afghanistan, the mountainous, inhospitable lands are home to Pashtun tribals and at least six recognised militant groups.  Reporting FATA is a perilous assignment for any journalist to accept.  The region has been targeted by American drone strikes ever since 2004. The drone war is one of the toughest stories to get at in the so-called war on terror.  Reporting on the effects of drone strikes on the ground - on the people there - has led to a number of journalists in the northwest getting killed.  FATA, and especially Waziristan on its southern edges, is militarised and locked down. Few reporters even try to go there anymore.  'Coverage is terribly difficult, without a doubt. It's tough to get there as a regular Pakistani. It's even tougher to get there as a journalist. And then when you sort of cross past certain areas from mainland Pakistan, well, it becomes a free-for-all. Your safety is not guaranteed. Most journalists who have been killed in the last decade or so in Pakistan have ended up being killed inside these regions,' says Wajahat Khan, an anchor for Dunya News.  The Listening Post's Meenakshi Ravi tells the story of one Pakistani journalist and what he is up against reporting on the state of war in northwestern Pakistan.  - Subscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe - Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish - Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera - Check out our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/",war-conflict,youtube

8M6MARLRPd4,"Immigration: No Way Out - We the People This film was originally broadcast on Al Jazeera English in the run-up to the US elections in 2008.  The Hispanic community of Tulsa, Oklahoma makes up more than one-fifth of the city's population. These numbers have allegedly allowed illegal immigrants to blend in more easily.  In 2007, the state of Oklahoma passed one of the country's toughest laws on immigration. The law, known as HB 1804, punishes anyone who hires or transports 'illegal' immigrants.  The law has forced many undocumented immigrants into the shadows. Families without proper documentation are scared to take their children to hospital when they are sick, and it is much harder for them to find work.  Immigration has been a key issue in the presidential elections for the last decade and voters are paying careful attention to what presidential candidates are saying about immigration reform.  We the People travels to Tulsa and explores how immigration policy has changed the face of this community.  - Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe - Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish - Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera - Check our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/",politics,youtube
